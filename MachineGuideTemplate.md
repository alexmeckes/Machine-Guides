This is a template for creating a machine guide to be a part of Gongkai AM. These are the general topics and format that are suggested to be followed in a Gongkai operating manual. Up for interpretation, feel free to use this as building blocks for creating your own guide.

#[Machine Name] Guide 

This document is meant to introduce users to [Machine Name] manufacturing. This is a living document and work in progress, and is produced under the direction of Gongkai AM.

Special thanks to the contributors of this guide;

#Design for [Printing Technique]
To design optimum parts to be built using additive manufacturing (AM), consideration must be given to the manufacturing process. Every step downstream in the process should be considered during the design stage (even if it is being outsourced to a service bureau) to ensure a suitable outcome. If the build and post processing requirements are not considered at the design stage, redesign and rebuild of the part may be necessary and additional costs will be incurred.

The most efficient parts are those specifically designed to be built using AM. The implications of unsuitable designs include:

1. Increased costs due to failed/repeated builds
2. Reduced functionality e.g. rough surfaces or features not to tolerance
3. Wasted resources if builds fail and parts have to be scrapped
4. Time delays caused by unsuccessful builds

AM Design methodology typically follows one of two routes:

##Improving an existing design
Using AM to lightweight, strengthen or add complexity to a component previously manufactured through traditional methods. In many cases, the AM version can be more complex and therefore add value by improving the functionality of the part.

##Solving a new problem
A new part has to be designed to suit its purpose. Different designs and manufacturing processes should be considered to ensure that AM is the most suitable option, and the part’s design should follow the guidelines below so as to take advantage of AM’s strengths.

In both cases the checklist (Figure 1) should help to ensure the design process considers the necessary questions.

#Manufacturing process [Add or remove sections as needed]
Typically, an [Printing Technique1] setup will include the following phases:

1.  **Vacuum down.** 
2.  **Ramp up.** 
3. **Calibration.** 
5. **Cooldown.**
6. **Removal.**

#Post processing [Add or remove sections as needed]
After a build is complete, it is removed from the machine by the operator. Various processes are then necessary before the completed part can be used.

1. **Powder recovery/Blasting:**

2. **Support removal:**
3. **Heat treatment:**
4. **Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP):**
5. **Machining:**
6. **Surface Finishing:**
  * **Automatic** –
  * **Manual** –
